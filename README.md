# PORTFOLIO

# About me
I am an ambitious, hardworking and creative person. I like meeting new people and testing myself (recently it was volunteering). <br>
Thanks to my last job at Comarch, I had the opportunity to participate and observe the entire cycle of creating software and graphic templates, from getting acquainted with the client's needs, the design stage, to compilation and testing. <br>
I am passionate about all kinds of physical activity from the gym to running.
